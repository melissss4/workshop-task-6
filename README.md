Objective:
Create an interactive nonsense poem generator using the rita.js library.
Use at least three different functions from the rita.js library to process the user's input.

Current Sketch: https://melissss4.github.io/workshop-task-6/ 

For this workshop I wanted to fork someone’s week 4 sketch because that is the week we focused on making buttons and incorporating text and entering the text onto our sketch with the buttons, I thought this would be a great starting point for this workshop as we would be needing to use those two elements to make a nonsense poem. 

I decided to fork David Surkalim’s week 4 GitHub repository. 
I really liked how they had the different sliders to change the colour of the background. I also found it very interesting how they decided to code it, as I had just been using the RGB 220, 220, 220 way.

I also really liked how he had the function with the button create this function. I thought this would be very interesting to incorporate into the nonsense poem function because they would have a cool juxtaposition.

Since I am not too familiar with coding and being able to merge code I wanted to play it a bit more safe and stick a bit closer to the code shown in the workshop, and the code written by David. However I wanted my randomised poem to instead of making a word rhyme I wanted it to take out a random word that was entered. 

After playing around with merging the code I did not have too many issues as both were easy enough to navigate.  The only issue I had was with the different buttons and text input boxes overlapping because I did not make their coordinates on the canvas far enough away from each other, so I quickly corrected that and played around with the text function and came to the realisation that I was very happy with the product created. I thought that with David’s interesting function added with my function to take out a random word, the poem had a really cool deconstructed feel to it.

However, I realised that with David’s function, his text did not clear from the input box after entering it, but when I kept trying to update the function I kept getting an error on P5.js and no matter what I did I could not get the text to clear after being entered. 
I took a couple days to refresh myself, and then coming back to the code I still could not figure out the reason for the error. I ended up leaving this fault (half because I liked how it looked, I think it adds to the deconstructed nature of the poem) and decided I would publish the code like this because it calls back to David's original code and I wanted to keep a lot of what he originally had since I did not want to completely decimate what he made since I liked it a lot originally.
