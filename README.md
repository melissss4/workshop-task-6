# Workshop 6
Objective:
Create an interactive nonsense poem generator using the rita.js library.
Use at least three different functions from the rita.js library to process the user's input. 
And fork someone's GitHub Repository

Current Sketch: https://melissss4.github.io/workshop-task-6/ 

For this workshop I wanted to fork someone’s week 4 sketch because that is the week we focused on making buttons and incorporating text and entering the text onto our sketch with the buttons, I thought this would be a great starting point for this workshop as we would be needing to use those two elements to make a nonsense poem. 

I decided to fork David Surkalim’s week 4 GitHub repository. 
I really liked how they had the different sliders to change the colour of the background. I also found it very interesting how they decided to code it, as I had just been using the RGB 220, 220, 220 way.

I also really liked how they had the function with the button to create this function. I thought this would be very interesting to incorporate into the nonsense poem function because they would have a cool juxtaposition.

Since I am not too familiar with coding and being able to merge code I wanted to play it a bit more safe and stick a bit closer to the code shown in the workshop, and the code written by David. However I wanted my randomised poem to instead of making a word rhyme I wanted it to take out a random word that was entered, so I scrapped the original code using the Rita library, and didn’t use it. This meant that instead of making a random word rhyme, my code would just take a random word out. I wanted to be sure I could easily add back in the Rita library so I left my code in a way that it would be easy to add back in.

 I also wanted to have the poem be written from the bottom up so that it is constantly changing, having a different beginning, middle and ending with each additional line added. I liked how this made it feel like it was alive and evolving. 

After playing around with merging the code I did not have too many issues as both were easy enough to navigate.  The only issue I had was with the different buttons and text input boxes overlapping because I did not make their coordinates on the canvas far enough away from each other, so I quickly corrected that and played around with the text function and came to the realisation that I was very happy with the product created. I thought that with David’s interesting function added with my function to take out a random word, the poem had a really cool deconstructed feel to it.

However, I realised that with David’s function, their text did not clear from the input box after entering it, but when I kept trying to update the function I kept getting an error on P5.js and no matter what I did I could not get the text to clear after being entered. 
I took a couple days to refresh myself, and then coming back to the code I still could not figure out the reason for the error. I ended up leaving this fault (half because I liked how it looked, I think it adds to the deconstructed nature of the poem) and decided I would publish the code like this because it calls back to David's original code and I wanted to keep a lot of what they originally had since I did not want to completely decimate what they made since I liked it a lot originally. 

I really enjoy playing around with it now.
